Dear candidate,

Thank you for taking the Openmarkets home test.

At Openmarkets, we frequently need to retrieve data from various sources and make that data available through our APIs. ASX listed companies are one of them. The list of companies is available online as a CSV (https://www.asx.com.au/asx/research/ASXListedCompanies.csv). Also, that list is updated once a day.

For this test, we want you to start a new API project (in java / kotlin) with one endpoint. That endpoint gets the ASX code of an ASX-listed company.
The goal of this test is to make it work with code that could be released to production (resilient, efficient, etc.).

Please submit your changes as a pull request.

All the best, and I'm looking forward to seeing what you come up with!
